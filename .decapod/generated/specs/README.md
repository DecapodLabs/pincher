# Project Specs

This directory is managed by Decapod for the human+agent engineering contract of this repository.
Canonical path: `.decapod/generated/specs/`.
Decapod updates and validates these files as intent and implementation evolve.

- `INTENT.md` captures why this repository exists and what outcome it must achieve.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` captures implementation topology, interfaces, and operational gates.
- `INTERFACES.md` captures inbound/outbound service contracts and failure behavior.
- `VALIDATION.md` captures proof surfaces, gate criteria, and required evidence artifacts.

Keep these documents current as requirements and implementation evolve.
