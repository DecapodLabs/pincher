# .decapod - Decapod Project Metadata 🦀✨

Welcome to the control-plane directory for this repo.

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize**: Run `decapod init` to set up your project
2. **Configure overrides**: Edit `.decapod/OVERRIDE.md` to customize behavior
3. **Read docs**: Use `decapod docs show <path>` to read constitution docs

## Summary

The `.decapod/OVERRIDES.md` file is your project-local override layer for Decapod's embedded constitution.

The embedded constitution (shipped with Decapod) is read-only baseline policy.
`.decapod/OVERRIDE.md` is where you add project-specific behavior without forking Decapod.

Keep overrides in the correct section, minimal and explicit.

## How to Use Overrides

The embedded constitution (read-only, shipped with Decapod) provides the base methodology. The `.decapod/OVERRIDE.md` file lets you customize behavior without forking Decapod.

**To add an override:**

1. Find the component section in `OVERRIDE.md` (Core, Specs, Interfaces, Methodology, Architecture, or Plugins)
2. Scroll to the specific component you want to override (e.g., `### plugins/TODO.md`)
3. Write your override content under that heading
4. Use markdown formatting for your overrides
5. Commit this file to version control

**Example override:**

```markdown
### plugins/TODO.md

## Priority Levels (Project Override)

For this project, we use a 5-level priority system:
- **critical**: Production down, blocking release
- **high**: Sprint commitment, must complete this iteration
- **medium**: Backlog, next sprint candidate
- **low**: Nice-to-have, future consideration
- **idea**: Exploration, needs refinement before actionable
```
